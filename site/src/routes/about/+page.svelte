    <p>in a way that relates to literature.</p>

    <p>Hello! I’m Elise. I'm a bilingual Theatre Studies and English student, and I write a lot. I also read a lot. And then, strangely enough, I write about what I read.</p>
    <br />
    <p>I also write music reviews – you can read most of these <a class="inline-link" href="https://musicboard.app/eliselazell">here</a> or here.</p>
    <p>I write many essays and my poor English teachers read each one. Miraculously, they have not cried when I have handed them another excruciatingly long essay thus far. In fact, one of my kind and wonderful English language teachers encouraged me to share my essays on this silly blog (if you’re reading this hello! thank you).</p>
    <br />
    <p>This is a jumble of essays and rambles about old hollywood films, gothic literature, poetry, music – mostly Tori Amos (did you know, before Tori Amos was Tori Amos, she was in a band called Y Can't Tori Read?) – and a few other things here and there, if they pique my interest.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Have fun!</p>
    <p>Élise x</p>
    <br />
    <p>To note: if I reference any sort of source, I’ll link editorial pieces or reference academic articles- I meditate upon a range of sources so it’s always useful to link or mention them.</p>
